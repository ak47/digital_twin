# Terraform — digital_twin

## Minimal flow

1. **One env var** (or use gitignored `terraform.tfvars` with `project_id = "..."`):

   ```bash
   export TF_VAR_project_id="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
   ```

2. **Apply** (creates GCP resources; GitHub deploy wiring defaults to repo `ak47/digital_twin`):

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **GitHub secrets** (once per project / after WIF changes). From repo root:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/print-github-actions-secrets.sh
   ```

   Paste the three lines into **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.

4. **CI** (`.github/workflows/deploy-api.yml`) only builds and deploys the container; it does not run Terraform.

### If `WorkloadIdentityPool` returns **409 already exists**

An old pool id may exist in GCP but not in Terraform state. This stack now uses pool id **`{name_prefix}-gha-wif`** (default `digital-twin-gha-wif`) so a fresh apply can succeed. You may delete the unused pool **`digital-twin-github`** in the GCP console (IAM → Workload Identity Federation) if it is still there.

### New image for Cloud Run

After building and pushing to Artifact Registry:

```bash
terraform apply -var="container_image=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/digital-twin/api:TAG"
```

See repository root `README.md` for broader context.
